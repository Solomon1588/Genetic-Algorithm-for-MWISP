# Genetic-Algorithm-for-MWISP
Implementin a genetic algorithm for Maximum Weighted Independent Set Problem

The format of the graph files is as follows:</br>
</br>
**Number of nodes**</br>
**Number of edges**</br>
**List of node weights** (format: X W where W is the weight of node X)</br>
**List of edges** (format: X Y which indicates an edge from node X to node Y)</br>
